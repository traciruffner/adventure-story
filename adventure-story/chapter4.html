              The full moon lit the way across rocky landscape to the wooded area where Angus had picked berries earlier.  As they approached, they heard the sound of voices close by.  They moved closer, being sure to stay out of sight.  About 40 yards off, they saw a group of about 4 men who appeared to be taunting something trapped in a pit.  There were torches surrounding the hole and they could hear the creature crying out in pain.  The men were jabbing it with long spears. Suddenly, 30 foot flames shot out of the trap lighting one of the men on fire.  Angus and Alick looked at each other wide eyed.  “Whit shuild we do? They’re killin’ it!”, whispered Alick.  Without thinking, Angus stepped out into the open and shouted, “You there!  Whit do ye think yer doin’ on our land?!”  Two of the men were on the ground tending to the burned man.  The other slowly approached Angus squinting to try to see him better.  Before reaching him, the man stopped and laughed.  “It’s jist a lad!  Run on home lad!  We’re doin’ man’s work!”  Alick stepped out of the shadows and stood next to Angus. “You heard him”, Alick said defiantly.  “You are on Turnebull land!”  This made the man laugh even harder.  “Woah!! Ha ha!  Look men!  He brung back up!”   The man rushed forward, swooped up Alick, and threw him over his shoulder.  “Put me down!”, shouted Alick.  Angus tried to grab Alick but the man was strong.  “Leuk here men!  I found a tasty munch for our dragon!”  The man walked toward the pit with Alick kicking and screaming on his shoulder.  Angus picked up the shovel he had brought with him, dashed in front of the man, and swung it right at his face.  The man reacted quickly and dodged the shovel.  He lost his balance and fell, dropping Alick on his way down.  Alick scurried out of reach while Angus stood over the man with the shovel.  “Noo jist haud on!”, said the man putting his hands up in front of him. “I wis only havin’ a bit o’ fun.  I wasn’t gunna hurt the lad.”  “Who are ye?!”, Angus demanded.  “We’re dragon hunters, lad. Dragons have come back and we mean tae exterminate them once an for all.”  “But, why? Why kill them?”, asked Angus angrily. “Dragons are a nuisance, lad.  They’ll kill yer livestock an will fly off with yer bairnes.  They are too dangerous to exist!” Angus shook his head. “No. They have been here for 100 years... right here on our own land... an we dinnae even know they existed!  Doesnae sound too dangerous too me!”, Angus exclaimed.  “Ye dinnae know what yer talkin’ aboot, lad!”, said the man growing impatiently.  “Leuk out!”, shouted Alick.  All of a sudden, Angus was grabbed from behind by another hunter.  Alick hesitated, looking unsure of what to do.  He then took off running back toward the castle to get help.  Angus struggled helplessly trying to free himself from the hunter’s grasp.  “Quit yer squirmin’”, said the hunter.  “Yer comin’ with us now, whither ye like it or not.”  “Pack up!” shouted the man Angus had threatened with the shovel.  Suddenly, all of the torches went out. From the pit, there was the brightest flash of light that any of them had ever seen.  Golden, shimmering particles rose up in the shape of a dragon.  “Whit the…!”, gasped one hunter.  “Let’s git out of here now!”, shouted another, but they were frozen in place.  All they could do was stare at the frightening display in front of their eyes.  Frightening?  Angus didn’t feel frightened at all.  He was awestruck!  A warm feeling rushed through him.  The golden ghost stretched out it’s wings, let out a roar, and flew straight through Angus’s body!  No.  Not THROUGH.  INTO his body!  Angus threw his arms out as if welcoming the creature.  His head fell back and his mouth opened wide.  Bright rays like sunshine seemed to shoot out of every visible opening.  The hunters screamed and released him. Angus stepped forward and turned to face the hunters. Still frozen in place, they began to whimper and beg.  “Please, lad.  Jist...jist let us go…. You’ll never see us agin.”  Angus could feel what was happening, but had no control.  “Yer eyes….yer eyes are glowing…*gulp*...bright orange.”  Angus opened his hand, palm facing upward.  A ball of fire appeared.  One of the hunters closed his eyes and began to pray.  Angus then turned and walked toward the pit….the grave.  He spoke but the voice was not his own.  It echoed like it was all around them.  “Born from fire and buried with fire”, the voice said.  He tossed in the flame.   The dragon’s corpse was immediately consumed by the the flame.  Within moments it was nothing but ash.  Angus turned back toward the hunters and collapsed.
